  First we briefly discussed the components of our project and what needed to be done:
    -Skeleton app
    -Implement camera
    -collect data (time consuming)
    -GUI
    -Twitter
    -Privacy
    -Terms and conditions
    -Meet Barak once a week
    -Document each meeting
    -Zenhub board
    
  Then we broke each component down further and decided who was taking on each task. We also agreed that while we would have tasks designated to an individual, we would go through the taks, with the other individual to ensure they knew how it worked, what was done, and would be able to do it if they needed to themselves.
