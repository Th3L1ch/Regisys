  First we briefly discussed the components of our project and what needed to be done:
    -Skeleton app
    -Implement camera
    -collect data (time consuming)
    -GUI
    -Twitter
    -Privacy
    -Terms and conditions
    -Meet Barak once a week
    -Document each meeting

  Then we broke each component down further and decided who was taking on each task.

  -Discussed location of the app and what had been started and done since last week.
  -Decided to use both GPS and Network provider in getting the location of the app.
  -Decided to allow the user to choose the accuracy of the location choosing from "none", "low" or "high" accuracy. This was decided due to legal reasons.
  -Tasks for the following week were to have the above option for users creeated and to have the task of using the location futher along.
