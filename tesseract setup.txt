The steps that follow are simple enough to follow, but no-one seems to have explained them well enough. It took me like a week online just searching for how to actully get started with this. I hope this helps --Conor K.

download tess-two-Master from
	--https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two#usage

unpack tess-two-master

download the ndk file (either r10 or r12. Not sure which is more suitable yet) from 
	--https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html

download apache ANT(1.10.1) from
	--https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

set up necessary path variables
	--NDK_HOME
	--ANT_HOME
	--ANDROID_HOME  <--(optional)

cd to the tess-two directory

run ndk-build. This can take a while, it took me like 2 hours so we have to be like super patient,
and if it doesn't run check the ndk version you're using. I've tried all 5 releases on their site and only 10e and 12b worked for me.
I went with 10e because I saw that was the most widely used version.

if ANDROID_HOME hasn't been set , then cd into C:\android\skd\tools and run this command
	--android.bat update project --path C:\tess-two-master\tess-two-master\tess-two --target 1

otherwise if ANDROID_HOME has been set you can run this command instead (not confirmed, I didn't set ANDROID_HOME)
	--android update project --path C:\tess-two-master\tess-two-master\tess-two --target 1

cd back to tess-two and run this command
	--ant release

This finished the build, now we just have to import this tess-two directory as a library in android studio

Some minor issues with maven and gradle still exist but they're easily fixed with google.
