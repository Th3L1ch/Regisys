    Set up github repository after a chat with Barak and Ciara.
    Started thinking of a list of issues that would need to be tackled.
 
29th September
    Brain Storming session with Ciara. Decided what we'd do over the next week or two, I couldn't sleep so I worked on the camera and got     a barely functional mess out of it. At least it's something.

     Fixed the camera app. Only need to work on the image's metadata for location, then we're well set up. tidied up the github by adding 
     more issues and sorting them more.
